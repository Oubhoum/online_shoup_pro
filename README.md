# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run json-server`

Runs the mock REST API using [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).  
Useful for simulating backend behavior during development.

By default, it starts on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

> Make sure you have a `db.json` file in the root directory or update the script in `package.json` accordingly.

To use this command, ensure that:
- You have installed `json-server` as a dev dependency or globally:
  ```bash
  npm install json-server --save-dev
